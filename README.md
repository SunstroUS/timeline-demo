# timeline-demo

> Demostration of how to create a github-like timeline.

[Live Demo](https://timeline-demo.vercel.app)

## What is it

I'm a big fan of the github timeline on a user's profile page, so I thought I would re-create it. This project uses next.js & styled-components both implemented in just plan javascript. Feel free to clone and do whatever you like.

## Development

Built with [next](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started). You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) & [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

```bash
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/SunstroUS/timeline-demo.git

# install dependencies
yarn install

# start app on port 3000
yarn start
```
